Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

I initially thought of Encapsulation being that I have attributes private to each class therefore other classes won't be able to access them. I think this is good because I know that I won't mess up file1 when I'm working on file2.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I tried multiple times for many different code-writting in this homework. For example I learned that Java is a language that starts from 0; i.e. 0 = what human think of as 1. I also found out that if I want a new Car for the carsList, I need to add the new Car in the loop instead of initiating it outside. I also used many exception messages to indicate an error in the number user inputed. An advice would be that to start early because this assignment is long and testing the code may take even longer.

Resubmit 2:
- for 5.3: added @param in Javadoc comments for constructors


Resubmit 1 :
- for 2.1: implements requirements for the classes
- for 5.3: 
    changed passenger names arguments lowercase
    added return in javadoc
    made javadoc 3 lines instead of one
